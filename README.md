# Python Logic Building – 30 Days Challenge

This repository contains my daily Python programs focused on **building strong logical thinking and problem-solving skills**.  
The goal is to develop a solid foundation in Python fundamentals, data structures, and data-science-oriented logic through **consistent daily practice**.

---

## Structure

- **Day01_Basics** – Input/Output, Conditions, Loops, Number manipulation  
- **Day02_Conditions_Loops** – Chained conditions, loops, basic arithmetic logic  
- **Day03_Loops_Patterns** – Loops, number patterns, sequences (upcoming)  
- … and so on for 30 days

Each folder contains:
- `.ipynb` files for each program
- Programs include proper docstrings explaining **problem** and **logic**
- Programs are designed to be **clean, readable, and beginner-friendly**

---

## Focus Areas
- Python fundamentals (variables, data types, arithmetic operators)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Number manipulation and patterns  
- Basic problem-solving for data science readiness  

---

## Goal
- Build **discipline** by committing code daily  
- Strengthen **logical thinking and coding skills**  
- Create a **professional GitHub portfolio** for recruiters and peers

---

## GitHub Consistency
- **One commit per day**  
- Clean folder structure per day  
- Docstrings for every program  
- Professional commit messages  
- Daily push ensures progress tracking
